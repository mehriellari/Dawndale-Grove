Dawndale Grove - How To Play


WASD - Move

"I" Keyboard Button - Inventory & Crafting

Mouse Scroll Wheel or Left Mouse Click - Toolbar selection

Left Mouse Button & Hoe Tool - Plow

Left Mouse Button & Empty Toolbar Slot - Harvest

Right Mouse Button & Mailbox - Interact with Store

Left Mouse Button & Inventory/Store Slots - Move Items, Buy and Sell

Left Mouse Button & Inventory Slot & Click Outside Inventory on Ground - To Drop Item


Notes and Troubleshooting:
- Remember that you can only harvest plants if you have an empty toolbar slot selected!!
- The store is the mailbox at the south end of the farm with the $ symbol. You have to be facing it to open it. Use the close button when finished
- When you buy and use seeds, they will say 0 left but still have one more use left before disappearing
- You can still plant the extra seeds or you can sell them or drop them and wait 10 secs for them to disappear
- Items will disappear after 10 seconds if dropped on the ground! Except for the hoe! 
- Left mouse is most interactions except the store is Right mouse button!
- Potions only cost 1 of each plant, however you can only craft ONE potion if you have 2 of each plant. One will still be left over
- I do not know why the issues with the seed count and potion crafting exist but they do not break the game
- The hoe might not work to buy? It also might be LARGE if dropped?
